      "Self learned Web Developer, building a scheduling app for a small tech consulting business.",
    content: `
      <p>
        This summer, I embarked on an exciting journey to create Brilliant
        Consulting - a scheduling application for a small tech consulting
        business. As a self-taught web developer, this project pushed me to
        learn new technologies and solve real-world problems.
      </p>

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        The client needed a comprehensive scheduling system that could
        handle multiple consultants, client appointments, and resource
        management. The existing manual process was time-consuming and prone
        to double-bookings.
      </p>

      <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
      <p>For this project, I chose a modern web development stack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript for
          a clean, responsive interface
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express for the server-side
          logic
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Database:</strong> MongoDB for reliable data storage
        </li>
        <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Planning to use Heroku for easy cloud hosting</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Key Features Developed</h2>
      <p>The application includes several core features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Interactive calendar view for appointment scheduling</li>
        <li>Client management system with contact information</li>
        <li>User and Admin dashboard</li>
        <li>Stripe payment integration for seamless billing</li>
        <li>Automated email notifications</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
      <p>
        Building Brilliant Consulting taught me the importance of
        user-centered design and iterative development. Working closely with
        the client helped me understand their workflow and create a solution
        that truly met their needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        This project reinforced my passion for creating practical solutions
        through web development and gave me confidence to tackle more
        complex challenges.
