          <p>
            This summer, I embarked on an exciting journey to create Brilliant
            Consulting - a scheduling application for a small tech consulting
            business. As a self-taught web developer, this project pushed me to
            learn new technologies and solve real-world problems.
          </p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            The client needed a comprehensive scheduling system that could
            handle multiple consultants, client appointments, and resource
            management. The existing manual process was time-consuming and prone
            to double-bookings.
          </p>

          <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
          <p>For this project, I chose a modern web development stack:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript for
              a clean, responsive interface
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js with Express for the server-side
              logic
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL for reliable data storage
            </li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Heroku for easy cloud hosting</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Key Features Developed</h2>
          <p>The application includes several core features:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interactive calendar view for appointment scheduling</li>
            <li>Client management system with contact information</li>
            <li>User and Admin dashboard</li>
            <li>Stripe payment integration for seamless billing</li>
            <li>Automated email notifications</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p>
            Building Brilliant Consulting taught me the importance of
            user-centered design and iterative development. Working closely with
            the client helped me understand their workflow and create a solution
            that truly met their needs.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project reinforced my passion for creating practical solutions
            through web development and gave me confidence to tackle more
            complex challenges.
