          <p>
            Starting my journey at California Polytechnic State University, San
            Luis Obispo, has been an incredible experience. As a first-year
            Computer Science student, I'm excited to share my initial
            impressions and goals for my time here at Cal Poly.
          </p>

          <h2>Why Cal Poly SLO?</h2>
          <p>
            Cal Poly's "Learn by Doing" philosophy immediately drew me to the
            university. The Computer Science program's emphasis on hands-on
            projects and practical experience aligns perfectly with my passion
            for building real-world solutions. The beautiful San Luis Obispo
            campus and strong industry connections made this the perfect choice
            for my education.
          </p>

          <h2>Academic Journey</h2>
          <p>My first quarter at Cal Poly includes exciting coursework:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>CSC 123:</strong> Fundamentals of Computer Science -
              Introduction to programming concepts and problem-solving
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>MATH 143:</strong> Calculus III - Essential mathematical
              foundation for computer science
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>ENGL 134:</strong> Writing and Rhetoric - Developing
              technical communication skills
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>GE Courses:</strong> Exploring diverse subjects to build a
              well-rounded education
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Campus Life and Opportunities</h2>
          <p>
            Beyond academics, Cal Poly offers incredible opportunities for
            growth. I'm actively seeking involvement in student organizations
            like the Computer Science and Software Engineering Club, and
            exploring research opportunities with faculty members.
          </p>

          <p>
            The collaborative environment here encourages students to work
            together on projects, share knowledge, and build lasting
            professional relationships. I'm excited to participate in hackathons
            and coding competitions throughout my time here.
          </p>

          <h2>Goals for My Cal Poly Journey</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Excel in core computer science coursework</li>
            <li>Participate in undergraduate research projects</li>
            <li>Secure meaningful internships in the tech industry</li>
            <li>Contribute to open-source projects</li>
            <li>Build a strong network of peers and mentors</li>
            <li>Develop expertise in emerging technologies</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
          <p>
            My first year at Cal Poly is just the beginning of what I hope will
            be an transformative educational experience. The combination of
            rigorous academics, hands-on learning, and the supportive Mustang
            community provides the perfect environment for growth as both a
            developer and a person.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm grateful for this opportunity and excited to see where this
            journey takes me. Go Mustangs! üêé
