          <p>
            Starting my journey as a first-year Computer Science student at Cal
            Poly SLO, I made one of the most impactful decisions of my academic
            career - joining Hack For Impact. This organization has opened doors
            to using technology for social good and connected me with
            like-minded peers passionate about making a difference.

            accessible and used to create positive change in our communities.

          <p>
            In my first quarter with Hack For Impact, I've been working on the
            UI/UX and Developer bootcamps to build a strong foundation in full
            stack development. Currently I have landed a role as a designer for
            Hack For Impact.
          </p>

            Being part of Hack For Impact has shown me that programming isn't
            just about writing code - it's about understanding problems,
            collaborating with others, and creating solutions that make a
            meaningful impact. I'm excited to continue growing with this amazing
            organization and contributing to projects that matter.
